## Reporting a Vulnerability or Issue

If you discover a security vulnerability, error, or any other issue in **Reminfo**, we encourage you to report it to us promptly. We take all reports seriously and will work with you to resolve them as quickly as possible.

### How to Report a Vulnerability or Issue:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability or error publicly**.
2. Please report vulnerabilities or issues by:
   - Sending an email to [zajaddou@student.1337.ma](mailto:zajaddou@student.1337.ma)
   - Alternatively, you can open a **private issue** on the GitHub repository.
3. Provide the following information:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability or error.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
   - The impact assessment of the vulnerability or error.
   - Any suggestions for a fix or mitigation (if you have them).
4. Upon receipt of your report, we will acknowledge it and begin investigating promptly.

## Best Practices for Reporting

To help us resolve your issue or vulnerability more efficiently, please ensure the following:

- **Provide enough detail**: The more detailed your report is, the faster we can address the problem.
- **Be specific**: If the vulnerability relates to specific conditions or configurations, please mention them explicitly.
- **Stay confidential**: If the issue involves sensitive information, please ensure you report it privately and avoid sharing details in public forums or issues.

## Security Best Practices for Users

While waiting for a resolution, please follow these best practices to ensure the security of your system:

- **Limit Privileges**: Avoid running **Reminfo** with elevated privileges unless absolutely necessary.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep your system and any relevant tools up to date to reduce the risk of security issues.
- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS when cloning or interacting with repositories to ensure encrypted communication.

## Disclaimer

We take every report seriously and aim to resolve issues quickly. However, no software is completely free of vulnerabilities. We encourage users to adopt additional security measures on their systems, such as firewall protections and system updates.

For any further questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to us at [zajaddou@student.1337.ma](mailto:zajaddou@student.1337.ma).
